## UPDATED FOR DESTINY 2

## Destiny Loadouts
Destiny Loadouts for Amazon Echo's Alexa

Destiny Loadouts lets [Destiny](http://destinythegame.com/) game players easily move items between their Guardians, and between the Vault, by "using their voice" with an Amazon Echo or other Alexa-enabled device.  Destiny Loadouts's goal is to let players transfer items to their guardians quickly, without the use of an external devices such as a phone or a laptop, and without the need to set down their controller.  Destiny Loadouts helps keep the user out of their menus and saves them time by removing the need for them to change characters, fly into a public space where they have access to the vaults, and transfer items.

Destiny Loadouts give players the ability to save a loadout per activity type and per character.  When a loadout is saved it can later be equipped by voice for that character.  In this way if you're waiting in orbit for an activity to start, you can easily equip your ideal weapons and armor for this activity while you wait on your friends to group up.  

Destiny Loadouts also allows you to transfer materials and consumables, and to evenly split them between your characters.  The split consumables option will transfer up to a maximum of a single stack's max size (such as 100 heavy ammo synths) to each character and deposit the remainder in the vault.  You can also transfer by intentional call, such as requesting to get 43 strange coins, pulled from the vault and/or other characters.

Destiny Loadouts is based on the same API service used by the official Destiny Companion app to move and equip items.  Therefore, Destiny Loadouts cannot delete your weapons or armor.
